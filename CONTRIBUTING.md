# How to contribute

For most problems such as language mistakes you can either create an issue or a pull request.  

## Adding another language
Fork the project and translate the workshop. Create an issue and I will create a branch for you with the English name of the language in lowercase. I will close the issue and you can create a pull request to that branch.
