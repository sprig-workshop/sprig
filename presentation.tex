Need a balance while benefiting from technology.

\begin{frame}{Why is privacy important?}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Manage your own Reputation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item How we are judged by others affects our opportunities, friendships, and overall well-being.
  \item Privacy enables us to control our reputation to some degree. Choosing what we want to share, with who with the right context is essential as we want to be judged fairly.
  \item
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{Question}
Have you ever experienced someone sharing one of your secret to others? \\
A crush you had?
\end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Respect for the Individual}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Privacy is about respecting the individual
  \item United Nations states in article 12 that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation.", and that one is protected by the law against such attacks.
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{Question}
How did it feel when someone shared one of your secrets?
\end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Limit Power}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The more someone knows about us, the more power they can have over us.
  \item Personal data can affect our reputations, and it can be used to influence our decisions and shape our behavior.
  \item Personal data can cause great harm and be used to control us.
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{Question}
Have you experienced that someone have threatened to tell something to someone that you did not want to share? That you liked someone?
\end{block}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Trust}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In all our relationships, personal, professional, and others we depend on trusting the other party.
  \item Trust allows us to be open and honest in relationships.
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{Question}
Have you experienced having your trust broken?
\end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Social Boundaries}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We learn from each other what is acceptable behavior. This lets us know what boundaries we should stay inside.
  \item We need to be able to access to silence and solitude, places to relax and escape from the gaze of others.
  \item As everyone is affecting the boundaries together each of our relations to privacy mater. Books like "1981" and "The Circle" illustrates this.
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{Question}
Have you ever told someone "To much information" or "None of your business"?
\end{block}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}{Control over one's life}
\begin{itemize}
  \item To be free one needs to have control over one's life
  \item personal data affects decisions about us.Do we get a loan? a license? a job?
  \item Knowing what data is used and how, as well as being able to correct the data is necessary to be in control over one's life in the digital age.
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{Question}
Have you experienced that some information about you have been incorrect without being able to correct it? Or that some information you have shared have been used in an unexpected way?
\end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Freedom of Thought and Speech}
\begin{itemize}
  \item If everything we read and watch is judged by others, exploring boundaries will seem dangerous as we are afraid of what others thinks or can do to us based on that knowledge.
  \item If everything we say in any context is recorded and can be used against us. What we say will be limited.
  \item We need to say and discuss topics that are not meant for everybody. Problems we have in relationships. Think of Dumbledore in HP?
  \item [Paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance)
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{Question}
Can you think of topics you would not like to discuss with your mom? your friends? The
\end{block} world in general?

\begin{frame}{Not Having to Explain or Justify Oneself}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Without the right context things we do can seem odd or embarrassing.
  \item Thinking about how everything we do is perceived by others can be a heavy burden.
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{Question}
Can you think of anything you have done that you would not like to have to explain?
